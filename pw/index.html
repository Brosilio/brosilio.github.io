        Using the same password everywhere is a terrible idea. By using this tool, you only need
        to remember one master password to generate any number of unique, secure passwords
        that only you have access to. It's important to note that you should NOT use your master
        password anywhere except for here. If your master password were to be stolen, the
        attacker would be able to find all your passwords. When generating a password for the first
        time, double check that you entered the master password correctly. If you made a typo and didn't
        notice, it's very unlikely that you'll find that password again.

        It may be a good idea to use the domain name ("example.com") of the website you use a password
        with as the key for that password. It's easier to remember that way. Maybe add a number to the end of it.
        Just don't forget the number, or you're screwed.

        This tool does NOT send any information anywhere; everything is done entirely in your browser.
        It might be a good idea for you to download this webpage by clicking <a href="password_generator.zip">[here]</a>
        to keep a local copy for yourself in case this site ever goes down.

        Based on the SS64 password generator: <a href="https://ss64.com/pass/">https://ss64.com/pass/</a>, except this looks cooler.
        Their explanation of why this is a good idea is much better than mine, so it's probably worth heading over
        there to read it for yourself.
